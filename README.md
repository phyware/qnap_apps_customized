QNAP apps customized

Often I found some design/bugs in Qnap apps. Although I report it or provide suggestion to them, they have their own priority to take these so typically it will take long time if not forever before the fix, even it's just a small parameter update. So I try to modify the smali code and put the recompiled apps here. Feel free to use it if it happens to be your pain point too.
